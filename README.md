# Scraping GPUs from Morele.net

## My second Python project

Thanks to this web scraping app I was able to find the most decent priced graphics card

## Update

Unfortunately, I needed to change base website from RTV EURO AGD to Morele. Euro company got brand new website and all of the tags I fetched previously are nearly impossible to fetch.

## Frameworks/libs I used:

+ Beautiful Soup
+ Requests
+ csv

To get more info check `requirements.txt` file
