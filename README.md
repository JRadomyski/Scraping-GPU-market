# Scraping GPUs from RTV EURO AGD

## My second Python project

Thanks to this web scraping app I was able to find the most decent priced graphics card

## Is being updated (6th of May)

Unfortunately, my app does not work anymore. RTV EURO AGD got brand new website and all of the tags I fetched previously differ from newer version.

## Frameworks I used:

+ Beautiful Soup
+ Requests

To get more info check `requirements.txt` file
