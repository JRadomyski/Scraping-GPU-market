# Scraping GPUs from Morele.net :mag_right:

This is my second Python project, a web scraping application, which helped me find the most decently priced graphics card.

## Future of the Project :crystal_ball:

The project will need to be updated periodically due to the changing HTML code of the website.

## Technologies :wrench:

The project was built using the following libraries and frameworks:

- Beautiful Soup :book:
- Requests :outbox_tray:
- csv :bar_chart:

To get more info, check the `requirements.txt` file.

## Documentation :book:

You can find the documentation for Beautiful Soup [here](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).
