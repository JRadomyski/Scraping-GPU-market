# Scraping GPUs from Morele.net

## My second Python project

Thanks to this web scraping app I was able to find the most decent priced graphics card

## Future of project

This project will need to be updated periodically because of changing HTML code of the website.

## Frameworks/libs I used:

+ Beautiful Soup
+ Requests
+ csv
