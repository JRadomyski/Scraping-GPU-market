# Scraping GPUs from RTV EURO AGD

## My second Python project

Thanks to this web scraping app I was able to find the most decent priced graphics card

## Needs to be updated

Unfortunately, my app does not work anymore. RTV EURO AGD got brand new website and all of the tags I fetched previosly differ from newer version.

## Frameworks I used

+ Beautiful Soup
+ Requests
